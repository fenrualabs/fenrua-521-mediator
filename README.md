# Fenrua-521 protected evidence pipeline

This local-only module implements the first deterministic path:

```text
KRN-INT-001 -> KRN-SCH-001 -> KRN-SEM-001 -> KRN-POL-001 -> KRN-REC-001
```

The module has no network client, model client, persistence adapter, generic
tool executor, or authority action. It accepts a typed Green request, evaluates
an evidence-disposition record, and returns a bounded receipt. The caller is
responsible for retaining receipts in an approved local store; this module
never retains a raw request body.

Run its focused tests from the kernel root:

```text
node --test mediator/test/*.test.mjs
```

The imported schemas and Green fixture suite are pinned in
`module-manifest.json`. The behavioural-card corpus is intentionally absent
until it has been individually reviewed.
